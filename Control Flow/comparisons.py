# Equal operator (==): it comapres two values, variables, or expressions to determine if they are the same
 # if the values being compared are the same then the operator returns true 
 # if the values are not the same then false is returned

# Not equals operator (!=): it compares  two values, variables, or expressions to determine if they are not the same
    # if the values being compared are the same then false is returned
    # if the  values being compared are not the same then true is returned

    # returns the opposite of what the original expression is 
not True

# Boolean Values

# And operator 
# variable1 and variable2 
    # if both variable1 and variable2 evaluate to true then the and operator returns true 
True and True 
    # returns true 
True and False 
    # returns false

# Or operator 
# variable1 or variable2
    # if one of  the two variables being compared is true then true will return 
True or True 
    # returns true 
True or False 
    # returns true 
False or False
