# Strings are a sequence of characters; letters, numbers, whitespace, or punctuation; strings are enclosed by double quotes ("") or single quotes ('')
 
 
myString = "My name is Madison"

# if a string needs to be broken up into multiple lines use backslash (\)
myStringLineBreak = "My name is \ Madison"


# String Concatenation 
one = "Hello"
two = "Madison"

both = one + two

# concatenation is the joining of two strings using the (+) addition operator
